# First-Login
# Login Interface HTML and CSS

This repository contains HTML and CSS code for a login interface. The HTML structure and CSS styles create a visually appealing login form with specific positioning, fonts, and interactive elements.

## HTML Structure
- The HTML structure includes a `<section>` containing a heading, form elements (email and password input fields), a signin button, and a "Forgot Password" link.
- Form inputs utilize Font Awesome icons (`fa-solid fa-user` and `fa-solid fa-lock`) for visual representation.
- Input fields have placeholders for email and password, providing guidance to users.

## CSS Styling
- The CSS file (`log.css`) includes various styling rules for positioning, backgrounds, fonts, and interactive elements.
- Elements are styled using specific IDs (`#t1`, `#i1`, `#i2`, `#b1`, `#f`, `#f1`) to define their appearance, hover effects, and positioning.
- Font families (`'Alkatra'`, `'Kablammo'`, `'Spectral SC'`, `'Ubuntu'`) are utilized for consistent text appearance.

## Usage
1. Include the HTML code in your project to create a login interface.
2. Link the provided CSS file (`log.css`) to the HTML document using `<link>` tags.
3. Ensure Font Awesome's CDN (`https://kit.fontawesome.com/67d9b093e8.js`) is accessible to render the icons correctly.

## Notes
